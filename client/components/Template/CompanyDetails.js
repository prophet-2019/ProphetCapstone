                    <b>Growth:</b> This is a measurement of Earnings per Share
                    growth within the last year.

                    Earnings per share (EPS) is the portion of a company's
                    profit allocated to each share of stock. Many investors look
                    to this of as an indicator of profitability and stock prices
                    can swing a lot after companies report these every quarter.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <b>Health:</b> This is a measurement of liquidity of a
                    company.

                  <p>
                    This is based on how much short-term liabilities they have
                    versus short-term assets. So it's measuring if they have big
                    payments to make versus how much they have in bank or stuff
                    they can sell to make the payment. Usually, being over 1 is
                    a good sign.

                  <p>
                    <b>Valuation:</b> This is a measurement of Price-to-Sales.

                  <p>
                    Price-to-Sales value of the dollar stock price a company is
                    currently trading at versus dollar sales the company does.
                    It can be calculated either by dividing the company’s market
                    capitalization by its total sales over a designated period –
                    usually twelve months, or on a per-share basis by dividing
                    the stock price by sales per share. The P/S ratio is also
                    known as a “sales multiple” or “revenue multiple.”

                    <b>Profitability:</b> This is a measurement of Return of
                    Assets.

                  <p>
                    Return on assets (ROA) is an indicator of how profitable a
                    company is relative to its total assets. ROA gives a
                    manager, investor, or analyst an idea as to how efficient a
                    company's management is at using its assets to generate
                    earnings. Return on assets is displayed as a percentage and
                    its calculated as: ROA = Net Income / Total Assets
